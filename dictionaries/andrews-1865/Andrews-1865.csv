Its sound, in Hawaiian, is generally that of a in father, ask, pant, &c. but it has, sometimes, when standing before the consonants k, l, m, n, and p, a short sound, somewhat resembling the short u, as in mutter, but not so short. Thus paka, malimali, lama, mana, napenape, are pronounced somewhat as we should pronounce pukka, mullymully, lumma, munna, nuppynuppy, &c. reference being had only to the first vowel of each word. It has also in a few words a sound nearly resembling (but not so strong) that of au or aw in English; as iwaho, mawaho, pronounced somewhat as iwauho, mawauho.

hoo,"This word is the causative prefix to verbs; as, malu, to shade, hoomalu, to cause a shade, to overshadow; pono, good, right, hoopono, to correct, to make right; akea, to be broad, hooakea, or hoakea, to cause to be broad, i. e., to extend, enlarge, &c. See Gram.§ 33 and§ 212, and the conjugations 7, 8, 11, 12, 15 and 16.<br>This prefix, though originally adapted to the verb, continues its influence though the verb with its causative prefix becomes a noun, adjective or adverb. Ua hele oia i ka hoike, he has gone to the exhibition; he kanaka hoopunipuni, a man causing deception, i. e., a deceitful man; olelo hooino iho la, he spoke causing reproach, i. e., he spoke reproachfully. Before words whose first letter is a vowel, the last o of the hoo frequently coalesces with the vowel of the word following, particularly before a, e and o; as, hoano for hooano; hoole for hooole, &c. (See the preceding pages from the word hoaa to hoo.) Some words have haa for their causative prefix instead of hoo; as, haaheo for hooheo (from heo, pride), to be haughty. This form seems to come from the Tahitian dialect. A few words take both forms for their causative, as hoonui and haanui, from nui, to be large. Hoawi, to give, is used for hooawi, but haawi is used oftener than either.<br>Strictly speaking, hoo in a Dictionary should not begin a verb, but verbs having this prefix should be set in their places, and their meanings be modified by the hoo as it occurs; as, ike, to know, &c., hoo. or ho., to cause to know, to show, to exhibit; ikeia, to be known, hoo., to be made known, to be shown; ikeike, to know clearly, hoo., to make known clearly or frequently, &c. but a large class of words have been found beginning with the causative prefix hoo, whose roots are not known or have not come to light, or are out of use. It is true, such a root might be assumed as being in existence or having once existed, as Greek Lexicographers often assume an obsolete theme; but there would be much danger in Hawaiian of getting the wrong word: hence, we know not where to put such roots unless we retain the hoo for the beginning of the word. This occasions some repetition, but it is hoped it will not be a serious inconvenience. The following words beginning with hoo are such as were first found in that form and whose root was not known. They are now retained in that form because many are other parts of speech than verbs. Where the words beginning with hoo have been defined under their roots, the definitions here will be very short and the reader referred to the root.<br> Nā Lepili <br> Tags: grammar <br> Papa helu loli"

a,"in Hawaiian, as in most other languages, is the first letter of the alphabet; “because, if pronounced open as a in father, it is the simplest and easiest of all sounds.” Encye. Amer. Its sound, in Hawaiian, is generally that of a in father, ask, pant, &c. but it has, sometimes, when standing before the consonants k, l, m, n, and p, a short sound, somewhat resembling the short u, as in mutter, but not so short. Thus paka, malimali, lama, mana, napenape, are pronounced somewhat as we should pronounce pukka, mullymully, lumma, munna, nuppynuppy, &c. reference being had only to the first vowel of each word. It has also in a few words a sound nearly resembling (but not so strong) that of au or aw in English; as iwaho, mawaho, pronounced somewhat as iwauho, mawauho. To foreigners who merely read the language, the common pronunciation of a as in father is near enough for all practical purposes; but to those who wish to speak it, the mouth of a Hawaiian is the best directory.<br> Nā Lepili <br> Tags: grammar <br> Papa helu loli"

NOTE.—A nei is often written as one word, and then it signifies here, present place. A when pronounced with a protracted sound, signifies a protracted period of time, or distance, or a long continued action; as, holo ae la ia a—a hiki i ka aina kahiki, he sailed a long time (or a long distance) until he reached a foreign country.<br> Nā Lepili <br> Tags: grammar <br> Papa helu loli"

When emphatic, it is merely a disjunctive. Lunk. 6:39. NOTE.—In narration, it frequently stands at the beginning of sentences or paragraphs, and merely refers to what has been said, without any very close connection with it. In many cases, it is apparently euphonic, or seems to answer no purpose, except as a preparatory sound to something that may follow; as, akahi no oukou a hele i keia ala, never before have you passed this road.

hoo,"This word is the causative prefix to verbs; as, malu, to shade, hoomalu, to cause a shade, to overshadow; pono, good, right, hoopono, to correct, to make right; akea, to be broad, hooakea, or hoakea, to cause to be broad, i. e., to extend, enlarge, &c. See Gram.§ 33 and§ 212, and the conjugations 7, 8, 11, 12, 15 and 16.<br>This prefix, though originally adapted to the verb, continues its influence though the verb with its causative prefix becomes a noun, adjective or adverb. Ua hele oia i ka hoike, he has gone to the exhibition; he kanaka hoopunipuni, a man causing deception, i. e., a deceitful man; olelo hooino iho la, he spoke causing reproach, i. e., he spoke reproachfully. Before words whose first letter is a vowel, the last o of the hoo frequently coalesces with the vowel of the word following, particularly before a, e and o; as, hoano for hooano; hoole for hooole, &c. (See the preceding pages from the word hoaa to hoo.) Some words have haa for their causative prefix instead of hoo; as, haaheo for hooheo (from heo, pride), to be haughty. This form seems to come from the Tahitian dialect. A few words take both forms for their causative, as hoonui and haanui, from nui, to be large. Hoawi, to give, is used for hooawi, but haawi is used oftener than either.<br>Strictly speaking, hoo in a Dictionary should not begin a verb, but verbs having this prefix should be set in their places, and their meanings be modified by the hoo as it occurs; as, ike, to know, &c., hoo. or ho., to cause to know, to show, to exhibit; ikeia, to be known, hoo., to be made known, to be shown; ikeike, to know clearly, hoo., to make known clearly or frequently, &c. but a large class of words have been found beginning with the causative prefix hoo, whose roots are not known or have not come to light, or are out of use. It is true, such a root might be assumed as being in existence or having once existed, as Greek Lexicographers often assume an obsolete theme; but there would be much danger in Hawaiian of getting the wrong word: hence, we know not where to put such roots unless we retain the hoo for the beginning of the word. This occasions some repetition, but it is hoped it will not be a serious inconvenience. The following words beginning with hoo are such as were first found in that form and whose root was not known.

a,"in Hawaiian, as in most other languages, is the first letter of the alphabet; “because, if pronounced open as a in father, it is the simplest and easiest of all sounds.” Encye. Amer. Its sound, in Hawaiian, is generally that of a in father, ask, pant, &c. but it has, sometimes, when standing before the consonants k, l, m, n, and p, a short sound, somewhat resembling the short u, as in mutter, but not so short. Thus paka, malimali, lama, mana, napenape, are pronounced somewhat as we should pronounce pukka, mullymully, lumma, munna, nuppynuppy, &c. reference being had only to the first vowel of each word. It has also in a few words a sound nearly resembling (but not so strong) that of au or aw in English; as iwaho, mawaho, pronounced somewhat as iwauho, mawauho. To foreigners who merely read the language, the common pronunciation of a as in father is near enough for all practical purposes; but to those who wish to speak it, the mouth of a Hawaiian is the best directory.<br> Nā Lepili <br> Tags: grammar <br> Papa helu loli"
a,"is used for various parts of speech, and, of course, has various significations.<br> Nā Lepili <br> Tags: grammar <br> Papa helu loli"
a,"adv., When; then; there; until. With verbs in a narrative tense, it signifies when, and when, &c. as, a hiki mai ia, when he arrived. With nei it signifies a designation of place, as mai a nei aku, from here (this place) onward. Until, as noho oia malaila a make, he lived there until he died. NOTE.—A nei is often written as one word, and then it signifies here, present place. A when pronounced with a protracted sound, signifies a protracted period of time, or distance, or a long continued action; as, holo ae la ia a—a hiki i ka aina kahiki, he sailed a long time (or a long distance) until he reached a foreign country.<br> Nā Lepili <br> Tags: grammar <br> Papa helu loli"
a,"conjunction, And; and then; and when. When it connects verbs, it usually stands by itself; as, holo ka waa, a komo iho, the canoe sailed and sank. When it connects nouns, it is usually joined with me; as, haawi mai oia i ka ai a me ke kapa, he furnished food and clothing. A with me signifies and, and also, besides, together with, &c. When emphatic, it is merely a disjunctive. Lunk. 6:39. NOTE.—In narration, it frequently stands at the beginning of sentences or paragraphs, and merely refers to what has been said, without any very close connection with it. In many cases, it is apparently euphonic, or seems to answer no purpose, except as a preparatory sound to something that may follow; as, akahi no oukou a hele i keia ala, never before have you passed this road.
