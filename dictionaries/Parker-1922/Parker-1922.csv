hoo,"Causative prefix to verbs; as, malu, to shade, hoomalu, to cause a shade, to over-shadow; pono, good, right, hoopono, to correct, to make right; akea, to be broad, hooakea or hoakea, to cause to be broad, that is, to extend, enlarge, etc.<br>This prefix, though originally adapted to the verb, retains its causative meaning when the word becomes a noun, adjective or adverb. Ua hele oia i ka hoike, he has gone to the exhibition; he kanaka hoopunipuni, a man causing deception, that is, a deceitful man; olelo hooino iho la, he spoke causing reproach, that is, he spoke reproachfully.<br>Before words whose first letter is a vowel, the last o of the hoo frequently coalesces with the vowel of the word following, for the sake of euphony, particularly before a, e and o; as, hoano for hooano; hoole for hooole, etc. Some words have haa (but very seldom) for their causative prefix instead of hoo; as, haaheo for hooheo (from heo, pride), to be haughty. This form seems to come from the Tahitiian dialect. A few words take both forms for then-causative, as hoonui and haanui, from nui, to be large. Hoawi, to give, is used for hooawi. but haawi is used oftener than either.<br>Strictly speaking, hoo in a dictionary should not begin a verb, but verbs having this prefix should be set in their places and their meanings be modified by hoo as it occurs; as, ike, to know, etc hooike or hoike, to cause to know, to show, to exhibit; ikeia, to be known, hooikeia, to be made known, to be shown; ikeike, to know clearly; hooikeike, to make known clearly or frequently, etc. But a large class of words begin with the causative prefix hoo, whose roots are not known or are out of use. Though such a root might be assumed as being in existence or having once existed, as Greek lexicographers often assume an obsolete theme, there would be much danger in Hawaiian of getting the wrong word: hence it has seemed advisable to retain hoo as the beginning of the word. This occasions some repetition, but it is hoped it will not be a serious inconvenience.<br>This prefix always takes the glottal sound.<br> Nā Lepili <br> Tags: grammar <br> Papa helu loli"

hoo,"Causative prefix to verbs; as, malu, to shade, hoomalu, to cause a shade, to over-shadow; pono, good, right, hoopono, to correct, to make right; akea, to be broad, hooakea or hoakea, to cause to be broad, that is, to extend, enlarge, etc.<br>This prefix, though originally adapted to the verb, retains its causative meaning when the word becomes a noun, adjective or adverb. Ua hele oia i ka hoike, he has gone to the exhibition; he kanaka hoopunipuni, a man causing deception, that is, a deceitful man; olelo hooino iho la, he spoke causing reproach, that is, he spoke reproachfully.<br>Before words whose first letter is a vowel, the last o of the hoo frequently coalesces with the vowel of the word following, for the sake of euphony, particularly before a, e and o; as, hoano for hooano; hoole for hooole, etc. Some words have haa (but very seldom) for their causative prefix instead of hoo; as, haaheo for hooheo (from heo, pride), to be haughty. This form seems to come from the Tahitiian dialect. A few words take both forms for then-causative, as hoonui and haanui, from nui, to be large. Hoawi, to give, is used for hooawi. but haawi is used oftener than either.<br>Strictly speaking, hoo in a dictionary should not begin a verb, but verbs having this prefix should be set in their places and their meanings be modified by hoo as it occurs; as, ike, to know, etc hooike or hoike, to cause to know, to show, to exhibit; ikeia, to be known, hooikeia, to be made known, to be shown; ikeike, to know clearly; hooikeike, to make known clearly or frequently, etc. But a large class of words begin with the causative prefix hoo, whose roots are not known or are out of use. Though such a root might be assumed as being in existence or having once existed, as Greek lexicographers often assume an obsolete theme, there would be much danger in Hawaiian of getting the wrong word: hence it has seemed advisable to retain hoo as the beginning of the word. This occasions some repetition, but it is hoped it will not be a serious inconvenience.<br>This prefix always takes the glottal sound.<br> Nā Lepili <br> Tags: grammar <br> Papa helu loli"
