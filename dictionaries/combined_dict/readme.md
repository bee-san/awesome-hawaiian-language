Scraped automatically from the amazing [Combined Hawaiian Dictionary](https://www.trussel2.com/HAW/) created by the late [Stephen (Kepano) Trussel](https://www.trussel2.com/)

All credit goes to Stephen Kepano Trussel and Mitch Talmadge for this dictionary.

I converted it into other formats.

* hawaiian-words.csv > Mitch's original list.
* Combined-Hawaiian-Dictionary.csv > My personal scrape, which contains a lot less data.
* Combined-Hawaiian-Dictionary-2020-Mitch-Cleaned.csv > Mitch's list, deduplicated.


Please use Combined-Hawaiian-Dictionary-2020-Mitch-Cleaned.csv.
