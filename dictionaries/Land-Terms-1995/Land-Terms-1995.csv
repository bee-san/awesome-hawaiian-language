ahupuaʻa,"1. “An ahupuaa has been called the ʻunit’ of land in this country; but it is by no means a measure of area, for ahupuaas vary exceedingly as to size. Many ahupuaas are divided into ilis; other ahupuaas have no ilis in them, as for instance, Kualoa and Waimanalo on this island Oahu.” Harris v. Carter, 6 Haw. 195, 206 (1877). 2. “Ahupuaa means ʻa land division usually extending from the uplands to the sea.’” McBryde Sugar Co. v. Robinson, 54 Haw. 174, 177, n.3 (1973) (citations omitted). 3. “The unit of land was the ahupuaa, usually running from the mountain to the sea.” Territory v. Bishop Trust Co., Ltd., 41 Haw. 358, 361 (1956). 4. “Use of the term ahupuaa is misleading unless it is borne in mind that this term is used sometimes in the sense of a land subdivision smaller than a district, and sometimes in the sense of a tract of land held by the king or a chief as a unit under the feudal system then obtaining.” State v. Midkiff, 49 Haw. 456, 464 (1966). 5. “While theoretically an ahupuaa ran from the sea to the summit of the mountain, in order that the natives might share in all the different products of the forest, soil and sea, in actual practice, particularly on the island of Hawaii, the ordinary ahupuaa did not run to the top of the mountain but only to or into the zone of timber land, being cut off from the top of the mountain by the larger ahupuaas” (citations omitted). State v. Midkiff, 49 Haw. 456, 464, n.l (1966). 6. “The unit of land, so to speak, seems to have been the ahupuaa. Its name is derived from the ahu or altar (literally, pile, kuahu being the specific term for altar) which was erected at the point where the boundary of the land was intersected by the main road, alaloa, which circumferented each of the islands. Upon this altar at the annual progress of the akua makahiki (Year-God) was deposited the tax paid by the land whose boundary it marked, and also an image of a hog, puaa, carved out of kukui wood and stained with red ochre. How long this was left on the altar I do not know, but from this came the name, ahupuaa, of the pile of stones, which title was given also to the division of land marked thereby.” (CJL) 7. Subdivision within a mokuʻāina, kalana or ʻokana (SMK). 8. One of the smaller divisions of a kalana or district, made up of several ʻili, small districts, and under the care of a head man; the ahu or altar upon which the tax levied on the ahupua ʻa was laid; also used as a landmark (AP). 9.

Bishop Trust Co., Ltd., 41 Haw. 358, 361 (1956). 3. “There are two kinds of ilis. One, the ili of the ahupuaa, a mere subdivision of the ahupuaa for the convenience of the chief holding the ahupuaa, as for instance, the ilis of Lihue and Waimanalo, in the ahupuaa of Honouliuli. The Konohikis of such iliainas as these brought their revenues to the chief holding the ahupuaa. The other class were the ili kupono (shortened into ili ku) these were independent of the ahupuaa, nor did they pay general tribute to it.” Harris v. Carter, 6 Haw. 195, 206 (1877). 4. “A portion of land similar to an ahupuaa only smaller and usually awarded to a lesser chief (nobility).” State v. Hawaiian Dredging Co., 48 Haw. 152, 162, n.ll (1964). 5. Subdivision of land. In re Application of State to Register and Confirm Title at Moiliili, 49 Haw. 537, 558 (1967). (Richardson, C.J., dissenting.) 6. “The ili of the ahupuaa was a subdivision for the convenience of the chief holding the ahupuaa, alii ai ahupuaa. The konohikis of these divisions were only the agents of the said chief, all the revenues of the land included, going to him, and the said land in Hawaiian parlance, ʻbelonging to the ahupuaa’(CJL). 7. A small district of land, next smaller than an ahupua ʻa.

ʻili kūpono,"1. “[An ʻili kūpono]. . .

Gay, 31 Haw. 376, 380-381 (1930). 2. “The lands were distributed in such manner that sometimes ilis physically situated within the outer boundaries of an ahupuaa were held by chiefs who paid no tribute to the chief holding the ahupuaa. These independent ilis were known as ili kuponos, in contradistinction to the ilis of the ahupuaa, which were subdivisions of the ahupuaa for the convenience of the chief holding the ahupuaa The ili kuponos were not considered part of the ahupuaa.” State v. Midkifſ, 49 Haw. 456, 465 (1966). 3. “It was a separate<br>and independent title, and not subservient to the ahupuaa.” Shipman v. Nawahi, 5 Haw. 571, 572 (1886). 4. A nearly independent ʻili land division within an ahupuaa, paying tribute to the ruling chief and not to the chief of the ahupuaʻa. Transfer of the ahupuaa from one chief to another did not include the ʻili kūpono located within its boundaries. Also ʻili kū (PE). 5. “The ili kupono, on the contrary, was nearly independent. The transfer of the ahupuaa to a new chief did not carry with it the transfer of the ili kupono contained within its limits. The chiefs previously holding the ili kupono continued to hold them, whatever the change in the ahupuaa chief, having their own koeles (chief’s patches) worked by their retainers. There was, however, a slight tribute of work due to the ahupuaa chief; sometimes one or two days in the month; sometimes even less, or only certain days in the year.” (CJL)."
ʻili lele,"1. “… The ili [lele] often consisted of several distinct sections of land, one, for instance, on the seashore, another on dry, open land or kula, another in the regularly terraced and watered kalo patch or aina loi district, and another still in the forest, thus again carrying out the equitable division system which we have seen in the ahupuaas. These separate pieces were called lele i.e., ʻjumps’ and were most common on Oahu. Indeed I know of none on the island of Hawaii.” (CJL). 2.

While the yield of the land was only what may be called domestic produce, such as poi, pigs, poultry and fish from its ponds or sea-front, the head man would partake of these liberally for his own use, without account. It was a superior position to that of the kanaka who labored on the land. Such a tenant of the land accepted the conditions of yielding to his chief, as an ʻauhau ku i ka wa,’ as much of these products as he pleased to take, and of the chief’s residence on the land, with the burden of entertaining him, for as long as he pleased, and still considered that he had been promoted to a desirable position in life. He would maintain the relation of an affectionate clansman, after the ancient Hawaiian custom, by rendering service, which was reciprocated by his occupancy of<br>the land as the manager of it.

ahupuaʻa,"1. “An ahupuaa has been called the ʻunit’ of land in this country; but it is by no means a measure of area, for ahupuaas vary exceedingly as to size. Many ahupuaas are divided into ilis; other ahupuaas have no ilis in them, as for instance, Kualoa and Waimanalo on this island Oahu.” Harris v. Carter, 6 Haw. 195, 206 (1877). 2. “Ahupuaa means ʻa land division usually extending from the uplands to the sea.’” McBryde Sugar Co. v. Robinson, 54 Haw. 174, 177, n.3 (1973) (citations omitted). 3. “The unit of land was the ahupuaa, usually running from the mountain to the sea.” Territory v. Bishop Trust Co., Ltd., 41 Haw. 358, 361 (1956). 4. “Use of the term ahupuaa is misleading unless it is borne in mind that this term is used sometimes in the sense of a land subdivision smaller than a district, and sometimes in the sense of a tract of land held by the king or a chief as a unit under the feudal system then obtaining.” State v. Midkiff, 49 Haw. 456, 464 (1966). 5. “While theoretically an ahupuaa ran from the sea to the summit of the mountain, in order that the natives might share in all the different products of the forest, soil and sea, in actual practice, particularly on the island of Hawaii, the ordinary ahupuaa did not run to the top of the mountain but only to or into the zone of timber land, being cut off from the top of the mountain by the larger ahupuaas” (citations omitted). State v. Midkiff, 49 Haw. 456, 464, n.l (1966). 6. “The unit of land, so to speak, seems to have been the ahupuaa. Its name is derived from the ahu or altar (literally, pile, kuahu being the specific term for altar) which was erected at the point where the boundary of the land was intersected by the main road, alaloa, which circumferented each of the islands. Upon this altar at the annual progress of the akua makahiki (Year-God) was deposited the tax paid by the land whose boundary it marked, and also an image of a hog, puaa, carved out of kukui wood and stained with red ochre. How long this was left on the altar I do not know, but from this came the name, ahupuaa, of the pile of stones, which title was given also to the division of land marked thereby.” (CJL) 7. Subdivision within a mokuʻāina, kalana or ʻokana (SMK). 8. One of the smaller divisions of a kalana or district, made up of several ʻili, small districts, and under the care of a head man; the ahu or altar upon which the tax levied on the ahupua ʻa was laid; also used as a landmark (AP). 9.

kauoha,"1. “Previous to the year 1846, it cannot be said that the common people had any rights of property in land by inheritance, since they were liable at all times to be dispossessed of their holdings at the arbitrary will of their own chiefs; and even the superior classes themselves, although they were accustomed when in expectation of death to designate the person whom they desired to be heir to their property, yet this will (kauoha), though generally respected, was liable at all times to be defeated or modified by the will of the superior chief.” Makea v. Nalua, 4 Haw. 221, 222-223 (1879). 2. “Reference however, to Hawaiian history will show us that such ʻkauohas’ or directions made by a high chief in the expectation of death were highly regarded, and as in the nature of advice, which were given effect according as the kind, after discussion with the chiefs, considered the instructions to be reasonable, and such a ʻkauoha’ was equally regarded whether purely oral or reduced to writing.” In re Estate of Kekauluohi, 6 Haw. 172, 177 (1876). 3. “[Kauoha] or oral bequest to these parties, a form of devise which still carries influence with Hawaiians.” Kahuaku v.

ahupuaʻa,"1. “An ahupuaa has been called the ʻunit’ of land in this country; but it is by no means a measure of area, for ahupuaas vary exceedingly as to size. Many ahupuaas are divided into ilis; other ahupuaas have no ilis in them, as for instance, Kualoa and Waimanalo on this island Oahu.” Harris v. Carter, 6 Haw. 195, 206 (1877). 2. “Ahupuaa means ʻa land division usually extending from the uplands to the sea.’” McBryde Sugar Co. v. Robinson, 54 Haw. 174, 177, n.3 (1973) (citations omitted). 3. “The unit of land was the ahupuaa, usually running from the mountain to the sea.” Territory v. Bishop Trust Co., Ltd., 41 Haw. 358, 361 (1956). 4. “Use of the term ahupuaa is misleading unless it is borne in mind that this term is used sometimes in the sense of a land subdivision smaller than a district, and sometimes in the sense of a tract of land held by the king or a chief as a unit under the feudal system then obtaining.” State v. Midkiff, 49 Haw. 456, 464 (1966). 5. “While theoretically an ahupuaa ran from the sea to the summit of the mountain, in order that the natives might share in all the different products of the forest, soil and sea, in actual practice, particularly on the island of Hawaii, the ordinary ahupuaa did not run to the top of the mountain but only to or into the zone of timber land, being cut off from the top of the mountain by the larger ahupuaas” (citations omitted). State v. Midkiff, 49 Haw. 456, 464, n.l (1966). 6. “The unit of land, so to speak, seems to have been the ahupuaa. Its name is derived from the ahu or altar (literally, pile, kuahu being the specific term for altar) which was erected at the point where the boundary of the land was intersected by the main road, alaloa, which circumferented each of the islands. Upon this altar at the annual progress of the akua makahiki (Year-God) was deposited the tax paid by the land whose boundary it marked, and also an image of a hog, puaa, carved out of kukui wood and stained with red ochre. How long this was left on the altar I do not know, but from this came the name, ahupuaa, of the pile of stones, which title was given also to the division of land marked thereby.” (CJL) 7. Subdivision within a mokuʻāina, kalana or ʻokana (SMK). 8. One of the smaller divisions of a kalana or district, made up of several ʻili, small districts, and under the care of a head man; the ahu or altar upon which the tax levied on the ahupua ʻa was laid; also used as a landmark (AP). 9.
