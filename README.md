# awesome-hawaiian-language
Aloha! This is just to keep track of language resources :)

This repo contains every Hawaiian dictionary in CSV format, with links to many other cool things.

* 🐝 emoji are resources I created or contributed to.
* ❤️ means I love this resource

# Call to action

🚨 I need digital media of the Hawaiian language 🚨

Preferably video with timed subtitles, but books are fine too.

With this I can:
* Create a frequency dictionary
* Create flashcard decks
* Create an audio word bank for people to learn pronouniciation
* Create a media bank of things to watch / study

Email me at hawaii@skerritt.blog if you can help.

# First Steps

## Apps
### Duolingo

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is the original app for Hawaiian.

However the app has become [AI first](https://fortune.com/2025/05/20/duolingo-ai-teacher-schools-childcare/) and uses AI for almost everything, meaning that a large portion of the lessons will feature AI generated content.

Around 10 years ago the content was created by native speakers. Since then Duolingo has:
* Removed all grammar exercises
* Added more words using AI
* Translated the course into other languages using AI
* Got rid of the human voices and used AI in their place
* Got rid of culturual lessons in the course

If you plan to use Duolingo, supplement it with these:
* ❤️ [Hawaiian Goodness' tips and grammar for Duolingo](https://useduforce.wixsite.com/hawaiiangoodness/duolingo-guides)
* ❤️ [Duolingo Hawaiian/English Flashcard Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2085481698)
* [Duolingo Fandom page on Hawaiian](https://duolingo.fandom.com/wiki/Hawaiian_Skill:Intro)

### ❤️ Mango languages

The best out there in terms of apps:
* Flashcard support
* Grammar breakdowns
* Culture lessons

It does use AI for somethings, but it is better than Duolingo and may be free on your library card.

However, note the community has built a lot on top of the Duolingo Hawaiian course to make it good. I personally use Mango, but you can use Duolingo.

Specifically, I use Mango with Yomitan to mine the audio and words into Anki flashcards.

Fundamentally you want to learn the language, time spent bickering over what app to use is spent wasted not learning the language.

### Drops

Vocabulary only app, free for 5 minutes every day. 

I suggest using Anki instead.

#### Yomitan 🐝❤️

Yomitan is a pop up dictionary that supports flashcards and native audio pronounication.

This is the bread and butter of the Japanese language learning community and is a big part of why learning Japnese is so simple (hard, but simple).

# Nerdy things
## Speech to text

There is currently no good speech to text model for Hawaiian. Whisper TTS has too high of an error rate.

This is likely due to the lack of Hawaiian audio with timed subtitles.

## Text to speech
There is currently no good TTS model because of the above issue.
