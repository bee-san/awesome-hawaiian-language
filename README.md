**I need audio and timed soft subtitles of the Hawaiian language**

Preferably video, but just audio is fine too.

If you can email me anything you have at github@skerritt.blog , i can improve the learning experience for everyone by:
* Creating a frequency dictionary
* Creating flashcard decks
* Creating an audio word bank for people to learn pronouniciation
* Creating a media bank of things to watch / study

Unforunately it has to be:
1. Timed subtitles, the subtitles have to line up with what is being said. A transcript does not help unless it is timed :(
2. Soft subtitles, subtitles burnt into the screen cannot be used.

**Sorry, I don't have this**

If you sponsor me on GitHub I can pay native speakers to write subtitles for things!

I do not have a job right now, so I cannot afford to pay for things out of pocket. :(
