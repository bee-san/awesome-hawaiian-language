# Call to action

**I need audio and timed soft subtitles of the Hawaiian language**

Preferably video, but just audio is fine too.

If you can email me anything you have at github@skerritt.blog , i can improve the learning experience for everyone by:
* Creating a frequency dictionary
* Creating flashcard decks
* Creating an audio word bank for people to learn pronouniciation
* Creating a media bank of things to watch / study

Unforunately it has to be:
1. Timed subtitles, the subtitles have to line up with what is being said. A transcript does not help unless it is timed :(
2. Soft subtitles, subtitles burnt into the screen cannot be used.

**Sorry, I don't have this**

If you sponsor me on GitHub I can pay native speakers to write subtitles for things!

I do not have a job right now, so I cannot afford to pay for things out of pocket. :(

## Apps
### Duolingo

[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) is the original app for Hawaiian.

However the app has become [AI first](https://fortune.com/2025/05/20/duolingo-ai-teacher-schools-childcare/) and uses AI for almost everything, meaning that a large portion of the lessons will feature AI generated content.

Around 10 years ago the content was created by native speakers. Since then Duolingo has:
* Removed all grammar exercises
* Added more words using AI
* Translated the course into other languages using AI
* Got rid of the human voices and used AI in their place
* Got rid of culturual lessons in the course
